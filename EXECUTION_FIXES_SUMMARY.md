# EMDX Execution System Comprehensive Fix - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes implemented for the EMDX execution system based on the gameplan in emdx #1045.

## Problems Addressed

1. **Git branch management** - Old branches blocking new executions
2. **Process management** - Zombie processes consuming resources  
3. **Database state** - 94 stuck executions marked as 'running'
4. **Environment consistency** - Ensuring correct Python environment
5. **Execution tracking** - Proper ID management between TUI and CLI

## Implementation Summary

### Phase 1: Cleanup Scripts ✅

#### 1.1 Branch Cleanup Utility
- Added `emdx maintain cleanup --branches` command
- Lists all exec-* branches and deletes merged ones
- Supports `--force` to delete unmerged branches
- Age filtering with `--age` parameter

#### 1.2 Process Management Utility  
- Added `emdx maintain cleanup --processes` command
- Detects zombie, stuck (>2h runtime), and orphaned processes
- Safe termination with graceful shutdown attempt first
- Memory usage tracking for processes

#### 1.3 Database Cleanup Utility
- Added `emdx maintain cleanup --executions` command
- Finds stuck 'running' executions using heartbeat
- Marks stale executions as 'failed' with appropriate exit codes
- Added `emdx maintain cleanup-dirs` for temp directory cleanup

### Phase 2: Execution Robustness ✅

#### 2.1 Branch Name Generation
- Enhanced `generate_unique_execution_id()` with UUID component
- Improved directory name sanitization
- Added collision detection with retry logic
- Fallback to random directory names if needed

#### 2.2 Process Lifecycle Management
- Added heartbeat mechanism (30-second updates)
- Implemented `ExecutionMonitor` service
- Added `emdx exec health` command for health checks
- Added `emdx exec monitor` for real-time monitoring
- PID tracking for all executions

#### 2.3 Environment Validation
- Added `validate_execution_environment()` function
- Created `emdx exec check-env` command
- Checks for Claude, Git, Python, and EMDX availability
- Clear error messages with installation links

### Phase 3: Execution Flow Improvements ✅

#### 3.1 Unified Execution Path
- Both TUI and CLI use `execute_document_smart_background()`
- Consistent execution ID generation across interfaces
- Single source of truth for execution creation

#### 3.2 Better Error Handling
- Environment validation before execution
- Descriptive error messages with solutions
- Proper error propagation through wrapper
- Graceful handling of missing dependencies

#### 3.3 Execution Monitoring
- `emdx exec list` - List recent executions with status
- `emdx exec stats` - Show execution statistics
- `emdx exec health` - Detailed health status
- `emdx exec monitor` - Real-time process monitoring

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation ✅

Created test scripts in `tests/test_execution_system.py` covering:
- Execution ID uniqueness
- Cleanup command functionality
- Monitoring command functionality
- Environment validation

## New Commands Summary

### Cleanup Commands
```bash
# Clean everything (dry run by default)
emdx maintain cleanup --all

# Clean specific resources
emdx maintain cleanup --branches [--force] [--age 7]
emdx maintain cleanup --processes
emdx maintain cleanup --executions
emdx maintain cleanup-dirs [--age 24]

# Execute cleanup (not dry run)
emdx maintain cleanup --all --execute
```

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# List executions
emdx exec list [--limit 20]

# Show statistics
emdx exec stats

# Check health of running executions
emdx exec health

# Real-time monitoring
emdx exec monitor [--interval 5]

# Check environment
emdx exec check-env [--verbose]
```

## Database Schema Changes

Added to executions table:
- `pid` column for process tracking
- `last_heartbeat` column for health monitoring  
- Index on `(status, last_heartbeat)` for efficient queries

## Key Files Modified

- `emdx/commands/maintain.py` - Added cleanup commands
- `emdx/commands/executions.py` - Added monitoring commands
- `emdx/models/executions.py` - Added heartbeat and stale detection
- `emdx/services/execution_monitor.py` - New service for health checks
- `emdx/utils/claude_wrapper.py` - Added heartbeat thread
- `emdx/commands/claude_execute.py` - Enhanced ID generation and validation
- `emdx/ui/document_browser.py` - Unified execution path

## Success Metrics

✅ **No duplicate execution IDs** - UUID-based generation ensures uniqueness
✅ **No zombie processes** - Heartbeat monitoring and cleanup utilities
✅ **Clear execution state** - Database accurately reflects reality
✅ **Consistent behavior** - TUI and CLI use same execution path
✅ **Helpful errors** - Environment validation with actionable messages
✅ **Resource efficiency** - Automated cleanup of stale resources

## Migration Notes

For existing installations:
1. Database migrations will run automatically to add new columns
2. Old stuck executions can be cleaned with `emdx maintain cleanup --executions --execute`
3. Old branches can be cleaned with `emdx maintain cleanup --branches --execute`
4. No breaking changes - all existing functionality preserved

## Future Enhancements

- Configurable timeout values
- Execution history archival
- Resource usage limits
- Distributed execution support
- Automatic cleanup scheduling
