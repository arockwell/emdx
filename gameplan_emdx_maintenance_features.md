# Gameplan: Implement EMDX Maintenance & Analysis Features

## Overview
Transform EMDX from a knowledge storage system into an intelligent knowledge management platform by integrating the powerful analysis and cleanup capabilities we've developed. This will help users maintain high-quality, organized knowledge bases automatically.

## Goals
1. Integrate duplicate detection and removal into core EMDX
2. Add automated cleanup capabilities for empty/low-quality documents
3. Implement smart auto-tagging based on content patterns
4. Create health monitoring and reporting features
5. Build proactive maintenance suggestions

## Success Criteria
- Users can run `emdx clean` to automatically optimize their knowledge base
- Duplicate detection prevents accidental duplication at save time
- Auto-tagging achieves >90% accuracy for common document types
- Health metrics are visible and actionable
- Maintenance tasks can be automated via configuration

   - Test dry-run functionality

### Phase 2: Smart Tagging System (Week 2)
**Goal**: Automated document organization

#### Tasks:
1. Create `emdx/services/auto_tagger.py`
   - Pattern-based tag detection
   - Title prefix mapping (Gameplan: â†’ ðŸŽ¯)
   - Content analysis for tags
   - Confidence scoring

2. Enhance `emdx tag` command
   - Add `--auto` flag for bulk auto-tagging
   - Add `--suggest` flag for recommendations
   - Add `--batch` for pattern-based tagging
   - Interactive confirmation mode

3. Create tagging configuration
   - User-defined patterns in `~/.config/emdx/tagging.yaml`
   - Default patterns for common types
   - Exclusion rules

4. Integration with save command
   - Auto-suggest tags on save
   - Optional auto-tagging on save
   - Duplicate warning on save

### Phase 3: Health Monitoring (Week 3)
**Goal**: Proactive knowledge base maintenance

#### Tasks:
1. Create `emdx health` command
   - Overall health score calculation
   - Project health metrics
   - Tag coverage analysis
   - Success rate tracking
   - Growth trends

2. Create `emdx/services/health_monitor.py`
   - Define health metrics
   - Score calculation algorithms
   - Trend analysis
   - Recommendations engine

3. Add maintenance scheduling
   - Weekly/monthly analysis reports
   - Email or notification integration
   - Automated cleanup scheduling

4. Create health dashboard
   - Rich terminal UI for health metrics
   - Export to HTML report
   - Historical tracking

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
**Goal**: Intelligent maintenance automation

#### Tasks:
1. Implement smart features
   - `emdx merge` - Intelligent document merging
   - `emdx dedupe --fuzzy` - Near-duplicate detection
   - `emdx gc` - Garbage collection command

2. Add workflow automation
   - Gameplan lifecycle tracking
   - Auto-archive stale documents
   - Success/failure pattern detection

3. Create maintenance hooks
   - Pre-save duplicate check
   - Post-save auto-tagging
   - Weekly cleanup reminders

4. Configuration management
   - Maintenance preferences
   - Quality thresholds
   - Automation rules

## Technical Architecture

### New Modules Structure:
```
emdx/
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analyze.py      # Enhanced with new subcommands
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ clean.py        # New cleanup commands
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ health.py       # New health monitoring
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ maintenance.py  # Maintenance utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ duplicate_detector.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auto_tagger.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ health_monitor.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ document_analyzer.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ maintenance_scheduler.py
â””â”€â”€ config/
    â”œâ”€â”€ tagging_rules.py
    â””â”€â”€ maintenance_config.py
```

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **Non-destructive by default**: All operations have dry-run mode
2. **User control**: Interactive confirmations for destructive operations
3. **Extensible patterns**: User-defined rules for tagging and quality
4. **Performance**: Batch operations for large knowledge bases
5. **Progressive disclosure**: Simple commands with advanced options

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each service module
2. Integration tests for command workflows
3. Performance tests with large datasets (1000+ documents)
4. User acceptance testing with real knowledge bases

## Documentation Plan
1. Update README with new commands
2. Create maintenance guide
3. Add configuration examples
4. Write troubleshooting guide

## Rollout Strategy
1. Beta test with power users
2. Gather feedback on auto-tagging accuracy
3. Refine patterns based on real usage
4. Progressive feature release

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Accidental deletion of important documents
  - **Mitigation**: Soft delete only, restore command, dry-run default

- **Risk**: Poor auto-tagging accuracy
  - **Mitigation**: Confidence scores, manual review, learning from corrections

- **Risk**: Performance impact on large databases
  - **Mitigation**: Indexed operations, batch processing, async options

## Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in duplicate documents
- 95%+ documents properly tagged
- 80% reduction in manual cleanup time
- User satisfaction score >4.5/5
- <1% false positive rate for duplicate detection

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve gameplan
2. Set up feature branch
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Create initial PR with basic clean commands
